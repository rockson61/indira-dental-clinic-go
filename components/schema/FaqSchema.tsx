          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Tooth decay occurs when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, builds up on teeth and produces acids that erode tooth enamel. This is typically caused by frequent consumption of sugary foods and beverages, poor oral hygiene, dry mouth conditions, or lack of fluoride. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups at Indira Dental Clinic can help prevent tooth decay.",

          text: "With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. The implant itself (the titanium post) has a success rate of over 95% after 10 years. The crown attached to the implant may need replacement after 10-15 years due to normal wear and tear. Regular check-ups with Dr. Rockson Samuel at Indira Dental Clinic will help ensure the longevity of your dental implants.",
